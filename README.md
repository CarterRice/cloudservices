Architecture & Technologies
--------
 The IoT Services Reference application is designed and implemented in Java using the Spring Framework (Spring Core and Spring JDBC) that implements its published REST API's based on the JAX-RS framework using the Jackson and Jersey implementation libraries. The JavaDoc for the application can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/markreha/cloudworkshop/blob/master/sdk/docs/javadoc/index.html).
